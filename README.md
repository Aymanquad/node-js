Online-Shop
( E-commerce website ) .

I used Nodejs , express and mongoDb to create this.

Before logging In the users can only view the products . 

Users can signup/Login into the shop with ease.

After logging In , 
Users can buy items in real time , view them inside the cart and change quantity of any of their items before purchase .

The admin has a right however to perform CRUD operations in the shop . Authorization was also added so that admins can only perfrom such activities on their products alone .
